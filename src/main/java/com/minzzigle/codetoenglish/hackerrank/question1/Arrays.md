This problem has two parameter. One is an array. Another is length of the array. The goal is to print the array in reverse order.
First, declare a string variable. Then read the array from last to first using for-loop. During for-loop, add a value of the array to string variable.
when the first value of array is added to the string variable, return this string variable.
